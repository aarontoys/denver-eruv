        Basic App Usage
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="list">
      <ul>
        <li>Start with the Map Tab. The Map Tab should automatically determine you geolocation (assuming you allow locations services).</li>
        <li>Tap on the map to add a pin. This action records the latitude and longitude of the pin.</li>
        <li>After placing a pin, the app will auto-navigate you to the Report Form Tab and load the nearest address to the pin.</li>
        <li>Next, complete the report by selecting issue & severity and adding comments and selecting whether or not a bucket truck is required.</li>
        <li>Next, click the camera icon to take a photo. If the photo is too large, you should receive a message asking you to retake the photo. Please note this feature only works on mobile devices</li>
        <li>If the photo is not too large (and if there is a photo), you can then submit your report</li>
        <li>All reported items can be found on the Report View tab. These are grouped by severity and the truck icon indicates that a bucket truck is needed for the fix.</li>
        <li>You can click on any item for more detais. This will show a larger picture and a map of where the problem is. Please DO NOT click the green checkbox as this will mark the item as completed/fixed.</li>
        <li>The Sections Tab is not yet complete. At a later stage, this will help with ensuring that each section is covered by someone and provide statuses of each section, i.e. up/down, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Add new fields (Comments and Bucket Truck) to Report Form</li>
        <li>Add Truck icon on Report View to show if bucket truck is needed</li>
        <li>Add Bucket Truck and Comments fields to Report Detail View</li>
        <li>Add "Copy" icon to Report Detail View. This actually copies the lat & lon to the clipboard, which can then be pasted into another app such as Google Maps</li>
        <li>Fixed issue with images that were too large that prevented reporting. Now if an image is too large, the options are changed programatically so the user simply needs to take another photo</li>
        <li>Also, the submit button is disabled until an image of the correct size is taken.</li>
